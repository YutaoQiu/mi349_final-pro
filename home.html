                    K/DAÂ 
                </strong>

                is a virtual girl group consisting of four themed versions of League of Legends characters: Ahri, Akali, Evelynn and Kai'Sa. American singers Madison Beer and Jaira Burns and (G)I-dle members Miyeon and Soyeon provide the voices of Evelynn, Kai'Sa, Ahri, and Akali respectively, though the characters have also been voiced by other artists. K/DA was developed by Riot Games, the company behind League of Legends, and unveiled at the 2018 League of Legends World Championship with an augmented reality live performance of their first song, "Pop/Stars". A music video of the song uploaded to YouTube subsequently went viral, surpassing 100 million views in one month, and reaching 400 million views, as well as topping Billboard's World Digital Song Sales chart. This would be followed up with the release of an EP in 2020, entitled "K/DA: ALL OUT" and featured 5 new songs, most notably the title track "More" as it received a music video which has 54 million views as of December 2020
